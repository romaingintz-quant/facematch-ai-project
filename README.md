# FaceMatch: AI Facial Search & Retrieval System

This repository contains the code and documentation for an academic group project from ICAM. We built an autonomous facial recognition system capable of identifying and verifying individuals from an image database.

## 🚀 My Role & Contribution

While this was a group effort, **my primary responsibility was the core technical development of the "FaceMatch" application.**

My key contributions included:
* **Lead Developer:** Coded the end-to-end Python application, integrating all components.
* **AI Implementation:** Implemented the Deep Learning models (using TensorFlow/Keras) for facial feature extraction.
* **Computer Vision:** Wrote the computer vision pipeline (using OpenCV) for detecting and processing faces from images.
* **Backend Engineering:** Designed and built the optimized SQL-like database backend for high-speed vector search and retrieval.

Essentially, I was in charge of building the "engine" of the entire system.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack Used

* **Language:** Python
* **AI / Computer Vision:** TensorFlow (Keras), OpenCV
* **Backend & Data:** Google Drive / Google Colab (for optimized high-speed vector search)

## 🔗 Transferable Skills for FinTech & Quant

The architecture I built for this project—an optimized search and retrieval system for high-dimensional data (facial vectors)—is **directly applicable to FinTech and quantitative finance**.

This same architecture is used for:
* **Pattern Recognition:** Searching for similar historical price patterns in massive time-series datasets.
* **High-Speed Data Retrieval:** Quickly querying huge financial databases (e.g., tick data, order books).
* **Compliance (KYC):** This project is a direct parallel to the "Know-Your-Customer" (KYC) identity verification systems used in banking.
